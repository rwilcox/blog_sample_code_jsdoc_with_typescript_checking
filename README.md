An example project showing typechecking a "real world" (if you consider two files real world) Javascript project by way of Typescript and [Visual Studio Code's Javascript / IntelliJ support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/working-with-javascript).

See also [my learning docs section on doing just this](https://github.com/rwilcox/my-learnings-docs/blob/master/learning_javascript_jsdoc.md#javascript_typechecking_with_jsdoc) <-- also includes alternative research.

# Doing things with the project

    ` $ make docs ` # runs jsdoc with the proper config flag
    ` $ make lint ` # runs eslint with proper config / setup
